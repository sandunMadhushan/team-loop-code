# Getting Started with Project Sentinel

## Understand the Challenge

Open [project-sentinel.pdf](./project-sentinel.pdf) at the repo root—it explains the scenario, goals, and data formats in detail.

Additional videos and documents are provided in the [resources](./resources) folder to help you get familiarized with the context.

## Follow the Submission Playbook

Open [submission-structure/Team##_sentinel/README.md](./submission-structure/Team%23%23_sentinel/README.md) (replace ## with your team ID).

This README lays out the required folder layout, submission deliverables, judging criteria, and tie-break rules.

## Explore the Sample Data Stream

In streaming-server, run the provided Python simulator to replay combined JSONL datasets.

Use the sample clients in streaming-clients to observe banner metadata and live event payloads.

## Data Drops

You'll receive three datasets:

- **Initial dataset** - Provided in data/input folder for quick start and testing. Includes a reference output/events.jsonl showing all possible event types (not generated from the inputs).
- **Test set** - Delivered at quiz start via Google Drive. No output file provided.
- **Final set** - Delivered 10 minutes before end via Google Drive. No output file provided.

Generate events.jsonl for the test and final datasets and store them in evidence/output/test/ and evidence/output/final/.

## Live Review Reminder

The in-person judging walkthrough is strictly 2 minutes—practice your narrative and follow the README guidelines to stay on script.
